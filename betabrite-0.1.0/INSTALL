betabrite's limited functionality has been fully tested on Sun/SPARC
systems with versions 8 & 9 of Solaris with gcc 2.95 and 3. It
*compiles* on linux x86 (RedHat 7.3) but not fully tested.

Start by executing 'configure', followed by 'make' and 'make install'
(provided there are no errors generated). Default installs put the
"betabrite" binary in "/usr/local/bin".

Running "betabrite -h" displays the command line options. 

Example usage:

   betabrite -m "This is some text"

displays "This is some text" on the sign with auto-color
nd auto-display features. It uses the maximum hold time
available on the device and stores the message in file "A"
(see the PDF listed in the README regarding BetaBrite memory
files).


To read a message from a file, the command line would be:

   betabrite -M stufftodisplay.txt
