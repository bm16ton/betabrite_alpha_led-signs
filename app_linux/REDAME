This is some simple software in Python which writes the date to the
BetaBrite signs under Linux.  Run the "getweather2" scrip from cron every
20 minutes, and then run "britedate" from inittab.  Adjust the "britedate"
for the serial port and "getweather2" for the location, it's currently
pulling the location from Loveland Colorado.

I've been running this code for over 10 years, it works great.
